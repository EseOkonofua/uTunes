#uTunes
uTunes is a project made for my software development class. My team proposed an intelligent, flexible, lightweight music player that can be used without advanced computer or music knowledge. Users could import their music libraries and associate custom tags with their songs (ie. Rock, Happy, Sad, Party). Users could then quickly add songs to the playing queue by selecting which tags they want to listen to. This software was constructed using Microsoft Visual Studio & C++

*The main .cpp and .h files for the uTunes Program*

This repository holds the main Backend Classes used in the implementation of uTunes, there are references to C++ libraries such as SFML.
